## Introduction

This is a Python-based Dice Game with integrated Simulated Annealing optimization. It provides an interactive gaming experience while demonstrating how Simulated Annealing can optimize game strategies.

## Features

- Roll dice and compete against the house.
- Simulate multiple rounds of the game.
- Utilize Simulated Annealing to optimize your gameplay strategy.
- User-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-game.git

pip install tkinter  # Required for the GUI


## How to Play
- Run the `dice_game.py` script to launch the game.
- Click the "Play Round" button to roll dice and compete against the house.
- The game provides suggestions such as "Change a Die" or "Keep Both" based on your current score.
- Aim to maximize your score and outperform the house.

## Simulated Annealing
- The project incorporates a Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm.
- To experiment with Simulated Annealing, click the "Simulate Annealing" button.
- This algorithm fine-tunes your game strategy by adjusting dice rolls based on your score and temperature.

## Usage
- Execute the `dice_game.py` script to initiate the game.
- Utilize the intuitive GUI to play rounds and simulate game strategies.
- Experiment with Simulated Annealing to find optimal strategies.
